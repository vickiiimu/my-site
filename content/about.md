I'm a sophomore at MIT studying AI and physics. This site is my public lab notebookâ€”a space where I break down ideas, build things, and try to make sense of what I'm learning.

### I write about:

**Recreated from Scratch:** Reimplementations of foundational AI papers (transformers, diffusion, etc.) with annotated code and commentary.

**Projects in the Wild:** Personal experiments, Kaggle challenges, physics-ML crossovers, and anything else I canâ€™t stop thinking about.

Whether you're here to explore math, follow a tutorial, or just browse something unexpected, thanks for visiting.

*Open to collaboratingâ€”especially if you're working on something cool in AI or research you'd like to riff on.*
