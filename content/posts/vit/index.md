Convolutional neural networks have been the driving force behind almost every major breakthrough in computer vision — **but what if they’ve been holding us back all along?**

In 2020, a team of researchers at Google asked the bold question: _Can we throw out convolutions entirely and still build world-class image models?_  
Their answer — **the Vision Transformer (ViT)**— sparked a new era in deep learning.

I'm an undergraduate student at MIT with an interest in computer vision and generative models, and I recently implemented a Vision Transformer from scratch to better understand its architecture. _This post is a distilled guide to that process, blending theory, visuals and code._

We'll walk through how ViTs turn images into sequences, how attention works in this context, and how it compares to the CNNs you're used to. By the end, you’ll have a **working ViT in PyTorch** and a **much deeper understanding of how it all fits together**.

## 1. Background and Intuition

### 1.1 From Recurrent Models to the Rise of Transformers (in NLP)

Before 2017, NLP was ruled by RNNs and LSTMs: models that powered everything from _machine translation_ to _language modeling_. But despite their early success, they had fundamental limitations. Because they processed sequences one token at a time, training couldn’t be parallelized. And as sequences got longer, they struggled to retain information from earlier tokens. These bottlenecks made it difficult to scale up, especially for tasks that required a deep, global understanding of language.

In 2017, researchers at Google made a breakthrough in their paper [_Attention Is All You Need_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). It proposed a new architecture — the **Transformer** — built around a simple but powerful idea: **self-attention**. Instead of processing tokens one at a time, self-attention allows each token to directly consider every other token in the sequence.

> _Put simply, each word learns to ask questions (**queries**), decide what to listen to (**keys**), and gather relevant information (**values**)._

This mechanism eliminated the need for recurrence and fixed step order, sidestepping the main weaknesses of RNNs.

{{< figure src="/img/vit/RNN-vs-Transformer.jpg" alt="Diagram comparing RNNs and Transformers. On the left, RNNs process inputs sequentially from left to right, passing hidden states forward through time steps. On the right, a Transformer encoder processes all inputs simultaneously, with each input connected to all others using weighted attention lines of varying thickness. Arrows and labels highlight the difference in processing order and parallelism." caption="**Figure 2**: RNNs handle inputs sequentially, while Transformers attend to all tokens in parallel. Line thickness represents attention strength. Source: author." >}}

Within just two years, **Transformer architecture** completely took over NLP.  
It proved more efficient, easier to scale, and better at modeling long-range dependencies than any of its predecessors. Transformers quickly became the backbone of major breakthrough models: **BERT** (for bi-directional context), **GPT** (for generative, causal language modeling), and **T5** (for sequence to sequence tasks).

**RNNs were replaced by attention in NLP — but what about computer vision?**  
At the time, CNNs dominated the field, but they came with their own set of limitations. Convolutions are inherently local, making it difficult for CNNs to capture long-range dependencies. They also rely heavily on spatial prior and careful feature engineering.

So the natural next question emerged: *if attention could replace recurrence… could it replace convolution too?*

### 1.2 Can Attention Replace Convolution? The Shift to Vision

In 2020, Dosovitskiy et al. introduced the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** in their paper [*An Image Is Worth 16×16 Words*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929). They proposed a bold idea: *what if we treated an image like a sentence?*

Instead of relying on convolutional filters, they divided images into patches and fed them into a standard transformer. While early ViTs needed massive datasets to compete with CNNs, **the approach proved that attention-based models could work for vision**—not just language.

Since its release, the Vision Transformer has sparked a wave of improvements:

- **DeiT** introduced smarter training strategies to reduce ViT’s reliance on huge datasets  
- **Swin Transformer** added hierarchical structure to better handle local spatial patterns  
- **DINO** and **DINOv2** showed that ViTs could learn rich visual representations *without any labels at all*—unlocking powerful self-supervised features for downstream tasks.

What began as a bold experiment has now become a core building block in modern computer vision.

## 2. How Vision Transformers Work

### 2.1 Patch Embedding

Transformers were originally designed to process sequences, like sentences made out of word tokens. But images are 2D grids of pixels, not 1D sequences. So how do we feed an image into a transformer?

The Vision Transformer solves this by dividing the image into **non-overlapping square patches** (e.g. 16x16 pixels). Each patch is then flattened into a 1D vector and linearly projected into a fixed-size embedding—just like token embeddings in NLP.

For example:

- A 224x224 image with 16x16 patches produces (224/16)² = 196 patches.
- Each patch is of shape 3x16x16 (RGB).
- Each flattened patch becomes a 768-dim vector (common for ViT-Base).

Instead of a sentence of words, ViT sees a sequence of image patch embeddings.

{{< figure src="/img/vit/Patchembedding.jpg" caption="**Figure 3**: Patch embedding. Source: [Dosovitskiy et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)" alt="Patch embedding diagram from ViT paper" >}}

> **Analogy**: Just like a tokenizer turns a sentence into a sequence of word embeddings, the ViT turns an image into a sequence of patch embeddings.

### 2.2 Class Token and Positional Embeddings

Transformers need two extra ingredients to work properly with image sequences:

1. a **[CLS] token** to aggregate global information, and  
2. **positional embeddings** to encode spatial structure.

In ViT, a special learnable token is prepended to the input sequence. During self-attention, this token attends to every patch—and becomes the representation used for final classification.

Transformers are **permutation-invariant**—they don’t inherently understand order. To give the model spatial awareness, we add a unique positional embedding to each token in the sequence.

Both the `[CLS]` token and positional embeddings are **learned parameters**, updated during training.

### 2.3 Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)

At the heart of the Vision Transformer is the **multi-head self-attention mechanism**—the part that allows the model to understand how image patches relate to each other, regardless of spatial distance.

Instead of using one attention function, MHSA splits the input into **multiple “heads”**. Each head learns to focus on different aspects of the input—some might focus on edges, others on texture, others on spatial layout. Their outputs are then concatenated and projected back into the original embedding space.

**How it works, step by step:**

- The input sequence of tokens (shape `[B, N, D]`) is linearly projected into: **Queries** `Q`, **Keys** `K`, and **Values** `V`.
- Each attention head computes:

{{< figure src="/img/vit/sdp.png" caption="Equation 1: Scaled Dot-Product Attention" alt="Attention equation visual" >}}

- Multiple heads run in parallel, and their outputs are concatenated and linearly projected back.

**Why “multi-head”?**  
Each head attends to different parts of the sequence. This allows the model to understand complex relationships in parallel—not just spatial proximity, but also semantic structure.

{{< figure src="/img/vit/multihead.png" alt="Two diagrams. On the left: Scaled Dot-Product Attention showing the flow Q -> K -> V through MatMul, Scale, Mask, Softmax, and another MatMul. On the right: Multi-Head Attention with multiple scaled dot-product attention heads, whose outputs are concatenated and passed through a linear layer." caption="**Figure 4**: The left shows how attention scores are computed using queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V). The right illustrates how multiple attention 'heads' capture diverse representations in parallel. Source: Vaswani et al. ([arXiv:1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762))" >}}

### 2.4 Transformer Encoder

Once we have self-attention, we wrap it inside a larger unit: the **Transformer block**. This block is the fundamental building unit of ViTs (and NLP Transformers too). It combines:

- **LayerNorm → Multi-Head Attention → Residual Connection**
- **LayerNorm → MLP (Feedforward Network) → Residual Connection**

Each block enables the model to **attend globally and transform features** across layers while maintaining stability with normalization and residuals.

**What’s inside a ViT Transformer block:**

1. **LayerNorm** before attention (called _pre-norm_).  
2. **Multi-head self-attention** applied to the normalized input.  
3. A **residual connection** adds the attention output back.  
4. Another **LayerNorm**, followed by a small **MLP**.  
5. Another **residual connection** adds the MLP output.

{{< figure src="/img/vit/transformer.png" alt="Diagram of a Vision Transformer block. The input embedded patches go through LayerNorm, Multi-Head Attention, residual connection, then LayerNorm, MLP, and another residual connection." caption="**Figure 5**: ViT encoder block with attention, MLP, and residuals. Source: author" >}}

This structure repeats across all transformer layers (e.g., 12 layers in ViT-Base).

### 2.5 Classification Head

After processing the input through multiple Transformer blocks, the model needs a way to produce a final prediction. In Vision Transformers, this is handled by the **classification head**.

During the embedding step, we added a special **[CLS] token** at the beginning of the sequence. Just like in BERT, this token is intended to **aggregate information** from all the image patches through self-attention. After passing through all Transformer layers, the **final embedding of the [CLS] token** is used as a summary representation of the entire image.

## 3. Implementation Walkthrough

All core modules—patch embedding, MHSA, encoder blocks—are implemented from scratch. No `timm` shortcuts.

### 3.1 Patch Embedding

To convert image patches into a sequence of embeddings, we use a clever trick. Instead of writing a manual for-loop to extract and flatten patches, we can use a `Conv2d` layer with:

- `kernel_size = patch_size`
- `stride = patch_size`

This extracts **non-overlapping patches** and applies a **learned linear projection**—all in a single operation. It’s clean, efficient, and easy to **backpropagate** through.

```python
class PatchEmbed(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, img_size = 224, patch_size = 16, in_chans = 3, embed_dim = 768):
        super().__init__()
        self.img_size = img_size
        self.patch_size = patch_size
        self.num_patches = (img_size // patch_size) ** 2
        
        self.proj = nn.Conv2d(
            in_chans, 
            embed_dim, 
            kernel_size = patch_size, 
            stride = patch_size)
  
    def forward(self, x):
        # x shape: [B, 3, 224, 224]
        x = self.proj(x) # [B, emdbed_dim, H/patch, W/patch]
        x = x.flatten(2) # [B, emdbed_dim, num_patches]
        x = x.transpose(1, 2) # [B, num_patches, embed_dim]
        return x
```

### 3.2 Class Token and Positional Embeddings

Here we define a `ViTEmbed` module that:

- Prepends a learnable `[CLS]` token to the sequence
- Adds a learnable positional embedding to each token (including `[CLS]`)

This produces a sequence shaped `[B, num_patches + 1, embed_dim]` — ready for the transformer encoder.

```python
class ViTEmbed(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_patches, embed_dim):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Learnable [CLS] token (1 per model)
        self.cls_token = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, 1, embed_dim))  # [1, 1, D]

        # Learnable positional embeddings (1 per token, including CLS)
        self.pos_embed = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, num_patches + 1, embed_dim))  # [1, N+1, D]

    def forward(self, x):
        batch_size = x.shape[0]

        # Expand [CLS] token to match batch size
        cls_tokens = self.cls_token.expand(batch_size, -1, -1)  # [B, 1, D]

        # Prepend CLS token to patch embeddings
        x = torch.cat((cls_tokens, x), dim=1)  # [B, N+1, D]

        # Add positional embeddings
        x = x + self.pos_embed  # [B, N+1, D]

        return x
```

### 3.3 Multi-Head Self-Attention

Let’s implement one of the most important parts of the Vision Transformer: **multi-head self-attention**.

Each input token is linearly projected into a **query (Q)**, **key (K)**, and **value (V)** vector. Attention is computed in parallel across multiple heads, then concatenated and projected back to the original embedding dimension.

```python
class MyMultiheadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        assert embed_dim % num_heads == 0, "embed_dim must be divisible by num_heads"

        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.head_dim = embed_dim // num_heads

        # Learnable projections for Q, K, V
        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)

        # Final output projection
        self.out_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        B, T, C = x.shape  # [batch, seq_len, embed_dim]

        # Project input into Q, K, V
        Q = self.q_proj(x)
        K = self.k_proj(x)
        V = self.v_proj(x)

        # Reshape into heads: [B, num_heads, T, head_dim]
        def split_heads(tensor):
            return tensor.view(B, T, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)

        Q = split_heads(Q)
        K = split_heads(K)
        V = split_heads(V)

        # Scaled dot-product attention
        scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1))  # [B, heads, T, T]
        scores /= self.head_dim ** 0.5
        attn = torch.softmax(scores, dim=-1)

        # Apply attention to values
        out = torch.matmul(attn, V)  # [B, heads, T, head_dim]

        # Recombine heads
        out = out.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(B, T, C)

        # Final linear projection
        return self.out_proj(out)
```

### 3.4 Transformer Encoder

We now wrap everything together in a **Transformer block** — a modular unit that stacks self-attention and MLP layers with residual connections. This design lets the model reason globally (through self-attention) and then transform those representations (through the MLP), all while preserving stability via skip connections.

In this implementation:

- We use our own `MyMultiheadAttention` **class** from earlier to demystify how attention works under the hood.
- In practice, you can use PyTorch’s built-in `nn.MultiheadAttention` for convenience and efficiency.
- We apply **LayerNorm before** both the attention and MLP layers (a “pre-norm” design).
- The `mlp_ratio` controls the width of the MLP’s hidden layer (usually 3–4× wider than the embedding dimension).

Let’s build the full Transformer block:

```python
class TransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads, mlp_ratio=4.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim)
        self.attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim, num_heads, batch_first=True)

        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim)
        self.mlp = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(embed_dim, int(embed_dim * mlp_ratio)),
            nn.GELU(),
            nn.Linear(int(embed_dim * mlp_ratio), embed_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        # Self-attention with residual connection
        x = x + self.attn(self.norm1(x), self.norm1(x), self.norm1(x))[0]

        # MLP with residual connection
        x = x + self.mlp(self.norm2(x))
        return x
```

### 3.5 Putting It All Together

Now that we’ve built all the key components of a Vision Transformer — patch embedding, positional encoding, multi-head self-attention, Transformer blocks, and the [CLS] token — it’s time to assemble everything into a full model.

In the code below:

- We use our `PatchEmbed`, `ViTEmbed`, and `TransformerBlock` classes from earlier.
- The `[CLS]` token is passed through all transformer layers and then **normalized**.
- We add a **classification head**: a single `nn.Linear` layer that maps the `[CLS]` token embedding to class logits.
- This architecture mirrors the original **ViT-Base** (12 layers, 12 heads, 768-dim embeddings), but it’s easy to scale.

```python
class SimpleViT(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
        self, img_size=224, patch_size=16, in_chans=3,
        embed_dim=768, depth=12, num_heads=12, num_classes=1000
    ):
        super().__init__()
        self.patch_embed = PatchEmbed(img_size, patch_size, in_chans, embed_dim)
        num_patches = (img_size // patch_size) ** 2
        self.vit_embed = ViTEmbed(num_patches, embed_dim)

        # Stack transformer blocks
        self.blocks = nn.Sequential(*[
            TransformerBlock(embed_dim, num_heads) for _ in range(depth)
        ])

        # Final normalization before classification
        self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim)

        # Linear classification head (using the CLS token)
        self.head = nn.Linear(embed_dim, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):  # [batch_size, channels, height, width]
        x = self.patch_embed(x)         # -> [B, N, D]
        x = self.vit_embed(x)           # add CLS token + pos embed
        x = self.blocks(x)              # transformer layers
        x = self.norm(x)                # normalize CLS token
        return self.head(x[:, 0])       # classification using CLS token
```

## 4. Training the ViT

### 4.1 Dataset: CIFAR-10

We trained our Vision Transformer (ViT) on **CIFAR-10**, a well-known benchmark dataset with 60,000 images across 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, cats, ships). Each image is only 32×32 pixels, which makes CIFAR-10:

- *Lightweight* and quick to train on  
- *Challenging enough* to evaluate small models  
- *Easy to visualize*, which helps interpret what the model is learning  

### 4.2 Model Setup: Adapting ViT for CIFAR-10

ViTs were originally designed for large-scale datasets like ImageNet, so we made several adjustments to make training feasible on CIFAR-10 with limited compute:

- **Input size**: Resized to 32×32 to match CIFAR-10  
- **Patch size**: 4×4 → yields 64 tokens per image  
- **Embedding dimension**: 192 (smaller than ImageNet-scale ViTs)  
- **Depth**: 6 transformer blocks  
- **Heads**: 3 attention heads (192 ÷ 3 = 64 dim per head)  
- **Positional embeddings**: Recomputed for 64+1 tokens  
- **Batch size**: 80 — balances speed and memory on Colab  

```python
# Refactored SimpleViT config for CIFAR-10
model = SimpleViT(
    img_size=32,         # CIFAR-10 images are 32x32
    patch_size=4,        # 4x4 patches → 64 tokens
    in_chans=3,
    embed_dim=192,       # Smaller embedding size
    depth=6,             # Fewer transformer blocks
    num_heads=3,         # Divides evenly into 192
    num_classes=10       # For CIFAR-10
).to(device)
```

### 4.3 Training Setup

The model was trained using:

- **Optimizer**: Adam (`lr = 3e-4`)  
- **Loss**: CrossEntropyLoss  
- **Hardware**: Google Colab T4 GPU  

Training was efficient — about **30 seconds per epoch**, thanks to:

- Fewer transformer blocks and tokens  
- Larger batch size (80)  
- Explicit use of CUDA (`to(device)`)  

### 4.3 Results

We trained our Vision Transformer for **30 epochs**, totaling ~15 minutes on a GPU. By the end of training, the model achieved approximately **60% accuracy** on the CIFAR-10 test set — a solid baseline given the model’s simplicity and the relatively small dataset size.

As shown in the training plots below:

- **Training loss** steadily decreased, indicating that the model was effectively minimizing prediction error on the training set.  
- **Test accuracy** improved rapidly within the first 10 epochs, plateauing around 60% thereafter. This suggests the model learned quickly but struggled to generalize further without additional techniques like data augmentation or regularization.  

{{< figure src="/img/vit/ViTlossAccuracy.png" caption="**Figure 6:** Training loss and test accuracy over 30 epochs. Source: author" >}}

Here are a few **example outputs** from the model. While it correctly identified many samples (like cats and frogs), it struggled with visually similar classes (e.g., misclassifying a ship as an airplane).

{{< figure src="/img/vit/ViTpred.png" caption="**Figure 7:** Example predictions on CIFAR-10 images. Source: author" >}}

The bar chart below shows how well the model performed **across all 10 classes**. Notably:

- The model performed best on *ship*, *automobile*, and *frog* classes — likely due to more distinctive visual features.
- Performance lagged on *cat* and *bird*, which may be harder to distinguish due to higher intra-class variation and similar textures or shapes shared with other animals.

## 5. Limitations and Extensions

Despite their success, Vision Transformers (ViTs) come with trade-offs. Here’s a summary of what to keep in mind:

### 5.1 Limitations

- **Data-Hungry by Design**  
  ViTs lack the strong inductive biases of CNNs (like locality and translation invariance), which means they *typically require large datasets* to perform well.  
  → *This is why the original ViT was pretrained on massive private datasets.*

- **Quadratic Time Complexity**  
  The self-attention mechanism scales with the square of the number of input tokens — making ViTs *computationally expensive* for high-resolution images. For an image split into `N` patches, attention scales as **O(N²)**.

### 5.2 Extensions and Improvements

Researchers have developed several workarounds and improvements to address these issues:

- **DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer)**  
  A version of ViT trained *without large private datasets*, using *knowledge distillation* from a CNN teacher to improve performance on smaller datasets like ImageNet.

- **Pretrained Backbones + Fine-Tuning**  
  Instead of training ViTs from scratch, most modern pipelines use *pretrained ViTs* and then fine-tune them on downstream tasks with fewer samples.

- **Swin Transformer**  
  Introduces a *hierarchical* structure similar to CNNs by using local window-based attention that shifts across layers — making it *efficient* and *scalable* for high-resolution inputs.

- **Fine-tuning on Small Datasets**  
  Techniques like freezing early layers, adding task-specific heads, or leveraging self-supervised pretraining (e.g., DINO, MAE) can help ViTs adapt well to limited data.

In short, while ViTs opened the door to attention-based vision modeling, their full potential is best realized when paired with large-scale pretraining, architectural tweaks, or smart training tricks.

### About Me

I’m a sophomore at MIT studying physics and artificial intelligence. This   post is part of a series — **Recreated from Scratch** — where I reimplement   foundational AI papers to learn them inside and out. I’ll be posting new   walkthroughs every few weeks, diving into a different model or paper each time.

If you enjoyed this walkthrough, feel free to [follow me on GitHub](ttps://github.com/vickiiimu), [follow me on Medium](https://medium.com/@vicki.y.mu), or even [reach out](ttps://github.com/vickiiimu). I love chatting about research, open-source projects, and all things deep learning.
